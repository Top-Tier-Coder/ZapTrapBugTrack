                    Zap-Trap has Administrator, Project-Manager, Developer, and Submitter funtionality, allowing each role to interact with the ITS in different capacities.
                    Zap-Trap not only permits users to log defects found in their application systems, but affords them the ability to track progression until the issue is resolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built in C# ASP.NET Core 5, Zap-Trap uses the MVC design pattern with Entity Framework.
                    The front-end of the application is constructed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, and Javascript,
                    while the database employs Postgres SQL serviced through PGAdmin, via Heroku.
